He was one of the most   North Korean defectors, winning several human rights awards and inspiring a documentary as his memoir was translated into 27 languages.  Now the publisher of the book and its author say Shin    who claims to have been born in and escaped from a North Korean prison camp    has revealed that parts of the story he told weren’t true. Shin may have spent most of his life in North Korea at a different prison camp, rather than the total control zone that formed the title of his biography.  Shin’s accounts of his time in the gulag have been widely reported in interviews with media including CNN. He also wrote an opinion piece describing his experiences for CNN Digital.  Don’t discount N. Korean stories after defector’s recanting, advocates say, Blaine Harden, author of the book ”Escape from Camp 14,” said in a statement on his website over the weekend that Shin had changed ”key parts of his story.” ”On Friday, Jan. 16, I learned that Shin   the North Korean prison camp survivor who is the subject of ’Escape from Camp 14,’ had told friends an account of his life that differed substantially from my book,” Harden said. ”I contacted Shin, pressing him to detail the changes and explain why he had misled me.” Harden declined to provide additional details to CNN, but published a lengthy explanation on his website. A Washington Post story based on information Harden said he had provided to the newspaper said ”the most horrific details” of Shin’s story ”still stand,” but some of the times and places of the events in his accounts were wrong. ”From a human rights perspective, he was still brutally tortured, but he moved things around,” Harden told the Post, where he worked as a reporter for 28 years. Shin did not immediately respond to a request from CNN for comment. In a post on his Facebook page, he doesn’t go into details about the purported discrepancies, but he includes a link to the Post’s story and apologizes to his supporters.  ”This particular past of mine that I so badly wanted to cover up can no longer be hidden, nor do I want it to be,” he says. ”To those who have supported me, trusted me and believed in me all this time, I am so very grateful and at the same time so very sorry to each and every single one of you.” Inconsistencies highlighted, Shin ”significantly revised details of his early life,” said Harden in a statement. The inaccuracies include the following:  • In the book, in his United Nations testimony and in interviews with media including CNN, Shin has detailed torture and abuse he claimed occurred in a notorious prison known as Camp 14. Shin told Harden on Friday that he’d actually been transferred with his mother and brother to a less restrictive prison camp, Camp 18, when he was six years old. It was there, not at Camp 14, where Shin now says he witnessed authorities execute his mother and brother. • Shin had previously said that he had lived his entire life in Camp 14 before escaping in 2005. He now says he escaped from Camp 18 twice before    in 1999 and 2001, wrote Harden in his statement. During his second escape attempt from Camp 18, he was caught in China and repatriated to North Korea. First, he was sent to Camp 18 and later transferred to Camp 14 for torture and punishment, wrote Harden.  • Shin now says he was 20 years old when he was tortured as a punishment for escaping, wrote Harden. His original account indicated that he was tortured when he was 13 for plotting to escape. Shin had been saying that he was tortured when he was a teenager since his arrival to South Korea in 2006.  • Shin had described in the book that his finger was chopped off by an angry guard after he dropped a sewing machine in Camp 14. Now, Shin told Harden that his finger was mangled as a guard pulled out his fingernails as punishment for escaping.  ”When I agreed to share my experience for the book, I found it was too painful to think about some of the things that happened,” Shin told Harden. ”So I made a compromise in my mind. I altered some details that I thought wouldn’t matter. I didn’t want to tell exactly what happened in order not to relive these painful moments all over again.” Shin told Harden that he thought that dates, places and circumstances were not all that significant, according to the author’s statement.  Challenges with North Korea accounts, Accounts from North Korean defectors are often difficult to confirm, with lack of documents and the regime’s general secrecy.  Harden stated that he was working with the publisher to amend the book. It’s unclear what action the book’s publisher will take in response to the discrepancies in Shin’s story.  ”Viking, the publisher of ”Escape From Camp 14” by Blaine Harden, has been apprised that there were some inaccuracies in the story Shin   the subject of the book, told the author,” Penguin Books spokeswoman Louise Braverman said in a written statement Sunday. ”We are working with the author on an accurate understanding of the facts. North Korea has repeatedly denied Shin’s claims and described testimony before a United Nations commission by him and others as ”slander” put forward by ”human scum.” In a video posted last year on a website that carries   propaganda, Shin’s father denied that his son was ever in a prison camp. Shin said in response that his father had been taken hostage and was being used in a campaign to discredit him.  Human rights activists argue that changes in Shin’s account do not ultimately affect his testimony, saying they still believe he was tortured and that his story highlights the horror of prison camps.  The New York Times reported Sunday that Shin said he had held back about revealing inaccuracies in his story out of concerns that it could hurt his advocacy work. ”I dithered because friends feared the damage my coming out might do to the movement for North Korean human rights,” he said, according to the Times. In his Facebook post, Shin said he was not sure if he would be able to continue his efforts to end political prison camps in North Korea.  ”But instead of me, you can all still fight,” he said. ”I still have faith in you.”\n",

Internet cafe in Taiwan after a marathon   gaming binge, the island’s second death of an online gamer this year.  The man, surnamed Hsieh, entered the cafe in Kaohsiung, Taiwan’s second largest city, on January 6, Jennifer Wu, a police spokesperson from the Hunei district precint told CNN.  An employee found him motionless and sprawled on a table at 10 a. m. on January 8 and he was rushed to hospital, where he was pronounced dead from cardiac failure, she added.  ”He has been unemployed for a long time, and internet cafes were the only place he could go to,” she said.  ”His family said he would disappear for two to three days on end.” Police first released details of the case late last week.  It is not known exactly how long the man lay dead in the Internet cafe but police said his corpse had begun to stiffen so he must have been dead for several hours before they arrived on the scene.  Exhaustion, Police said gamers in the café continued as if nothing happened even when the police and paramedics arrived.  ”The CCTV footage from the Internet cafe showed that he had a small struggle before he collapsed motionless,” said Wu.  Cold temperatures and   from the long hours spent playing games likely contributed to Hsieh’s cardiac arrest, a police statement said.  According to the Taipei Times, the man was a ”regular customer” who often played for consecutive days.  ”When tired, he would sleep face down on the table or doze off slumped in his chair,” the staff member was quoted as saying.  ”That is why we were not aware of his condition in the beginning.” Taiwan is no stranger to deaths from marathon sessions of online gaming.

After four months of exciting gridiron action, America (and the world) has its Super Bowl combatants. The Seattle Seahawks will face off against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX on February 1 in Glendale, Arizona. Whether you’re a hardcore NFL fan or just a wannabe watching the game for the halftime show and commercials, here are 5 things you need to know for the Super Bowl: No. 1 vs. No. 1, This will only be the 11th time that the No. 1 team from the NFC will play the No. 1 team from AFC. And this matchup of No. 1 seeds is happening for the second year in a row. Usually one of the top teams stubs its toe in the playoffs on the way to Super Bowl glory.  Let’s do it again, Winning the big prize twice is just plain hard to do. Just ask Barack Obama. But if the Seahawks succeed in winning another championship in two weeks, they will be the first repeat NFL champs in a decade. No team has done that since . .. the New England Patriots in 2005. Making history, together, Speaking of the Pats, the Bill   Brady era in New England has been nothing short of phenomenal. The   combo has produced three Super Bowl wins, 12 division championships and a record of   together. But there’s more history to be made. Belichick    now the winningest coach in NFL postseason history with 21 wins    will become only the second coach to appear in six Super Bowls, while Brady will become the only quarterback to play in six Super Bowls. Roman holiday, After this year’s title tilt, the NFL will break with tradition (for one year) and ditch using Roman numerals in the Super Bowl name. The 2016 version of the championship game    the 50th, to be played in the San Francisco 49ers’ Levi’s Stadium    will simply be known as Super Bowl 50. The Roman numerals are set to return in 2017 for Super Bowl LI. Music, music, music, Some folks (OK, lots of folks) don’t care about the game at all. They’ll be watching to see who’s performing at halftime. After many years of halftime shows featuring a musical mashup of singers and groups (up until the Justin   Jackson fiasco) the NFL seems to have found a winner with shows focused on a single artist. Think of the great Super Bowl halftime shows put on by Prince, Bruce Springsteen and Beyonce. And Bruno Mars simply set the stage on fire last year. This year get ready to ”roar” with Katy Perry, and she’s bringing in Lenny Kravitz for backup. Idina Menzel (best known to little girls everywhere as Queen Elsa) will sing the national anthem.  Oh, and for those keeping up with such things (for entertainment purposes only, of course) the early Las Vegas line on the Super Bowl has Seattle as a slight favorite over New England. But that’s subject to change during the next two weeks of unyielding buildup to the game.\n",

                                             (CNN) Fitness expert and reality TV personality Greg Plitt died on Saturday after being hit by a commuter train in Burbank, California.  Police have ruled out suicide, Burbank Police Sgt. Chris Canales said. Plitt, 37, was shooting video with a small crew on the southbound track of the Burbank Metrolink station when an oncoming train struck him. Witnesses told police the train horn was blaring at the time of the accident, Canales said. It is unclear whether the crew captured footage of the incident. The retired U. S. Army Ranger Captain and fitness guru broke into television through ”Workout,” Bravo’s reality series about fitness trainers and models in California. By then, he was a known commodity in the fitness world who regularly graced the covers of fitness magazines, offering tips on how to carve killer abs and pack on muscle in minutes.  He had minor roles in TV and film before landing a part in Bravo’s new ”Friends to Lovers” show, which premiered on Monday. Bravo’s Andy Cohen said Plitt ”seemed invincible, like Superman,” someone who was ”as nice as he was beautiful.” Bravo also offered condolences. ”This is a terrible tragedy. Our thoughts and deepest sympathy are with Greg Plitt’s family and friends at this extremely difficult time.” Condolences and tributes also poured into his Facebook page. ”RIP Greg. You will always be remembered and will continue to motivate and inspire countless people!” People we’ve lost in 2015\n",
      "40004  Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) Government forces and rebels in Yemen agreed to a ceasefire Monday after heavy fighting in the capital, Sanaa, Yemen’s interior minister and a rebel official said. That news came after fighting around the presidential palace and came after Yemen’s prime minister went into hiding when attackers shot at him. Nine people were killed and 67 others injured iin the clashes, Yemen’s Health Ministry said. The Yemeni government, a U. S. ally in the battle against al Qaeda, described the fighting as a power grab by rebels known as Houthis, Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni country.  Turmoil between the two sides is worrisome to the West because a power vacuum in Yemen could benefit al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a terrorist organization based in Yemen that took credit for the attack on the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris it also tried to blow up a plane landing in Detroit in 2009. A Houthi delegate, Ali Daghshan, told CNN that the presidential committee had agreed to a deal after hours of negotiations. Interior Minister Jalal Al Rowaishan also confirmed the ceasefire had been reached. There are conflicting accounts of the cause of the clashes. Government officials characterize it as a power grab by the Houthis. Houthis say Yemen’s military attacked people demanding that authorities lift road closures introduced as a security measure after the presidential chief of staff was abducted in Sanaa a few days ago.  A Western diplomat in Sanaa told CNN the situation was complex. ”Today’s events appear to be the next stage in Houthi plans to extend their control in Yemen. But there are many players with many agendas. So this hasn’t finished playing out,” the diplomat said. It is unclear who fired first near the presidential palace Monday. Control of the palace is seen as key to the control of the country. There were reports of government buildings, a hospital and residential buildings being hit. The presidential palace is controlled by the government and mountaintops surrounding the palace are held by rebels known as Houthis, a senior interior ministry official told CNN late Monday. Both sides will remain where they are until a deal is signed, which is expected to happen Tuesday, said the official.  The Yemeni information minister told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour that government control is ”almost nonexistent.” When asked to described the situation on the ground, Nadia   said: ”This is almost a replica of what happened in September, on the 21st of September, when the Houthis came into the city and took over everything, and then there was the peace and partnership agreement, where they pulled back a little bit and allowed a government to be created.” ”Now, since then, the Houthis have not really left the capital. They’ve been around with their arms, and what happened is that they’ve been interfering in the government’s work, but we were trying to get this country going,” the minister said. The U. N. Security Council will hold a special meeting to discuss Yemen on Tuesday. Prime minister targeted, Prime Minister Khaled Bahah was fired upon when he left a meeting with President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi and the Houthi political group Ansarallah,   said. Bahah was unharmed and is now in hiding, she said. ”He is at his place, but currently he has been surrounded by Houthi militias around his place, and they have stationed themselves at rooftops of neighboring buildings. He is worried that the situation might escalate,” said the minister. The senior interior ministry official said the prime minister was inside the Republican palace, some 7 miles (12 kilometers) from the presidential palace. The gunfire came from a Houthi checkpoint near the meeting place, and the attempt to kill the prime minister was a breach on an earlier ceasefire,   said. But a senior Houthi official condemned the attack and denied the group had anything to do with it, blaming the attempt on an unnamed third party. Houthis said their convoy had also been fired upon after leaving the talks. Adding to the disputes, the information minister said Yemeni state TV and the   Saba news agency are now under the control of the Houthi political movement. But senior Houthi official Ali AlShami denied the movement controlled either news outlet.  There are concerns that as Yemen spirals into greater sectarian violence, al Qaeda, a predominantly Sunni group, will gain an even greater foothold there, with more recruits and a base from which to attack other targets.  ”This morning, it was so chaotic. They said that nobody knew what was going on and who was in charge, and these are situations where al Qaeda can easily infiltrate and create,”   told CNN. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has its home in Yemen, where in recent months, it has come under pressure from Houthi rebels and government forces. But the Charlie Hebdo attack may show the group’s apparent ability to direct operations beyond Yemen’s borders. It is thought likely that one or both of the brothers behind the attack in Paris visited Yemen and received weapons training from AQAP and that one may have met with the group’s former leader.  A U. S. official said the United States was monitoring the violence Monday and had sufficient military power nearby to evacuate its embassy ”on short notice” if needed. Power struggle    said gunmen linked to the Houthi political movement attacked the presidential palace in a bid to take control of the symbol of power. Hadi, the President, was not in the building and is safe,   said, but government officials were among an unknown number of casualties. Houthi rebels claimed responsibility Saturday for the abduction of presidential Chief of Staff Ahmed bin Mubarak.   said Monday’s dispute began when the government tried to implement a security plan as it feared more abductions of key staff. But a top Houthi official said Houthis tried to mediate with the army and asked for roads to be opened for citizens, which led to their people getting attacked. He said they then had to defend themselves. Hadi appointed bin Mubarak as premier in October, but the rebels rejected the nomination. Osama Sari, senior media adviser to the Houthi movement in Yemen, said the Houthis had detained bin Mubarak as a message to the President. It was because the President wanted to introduce a new constitution without the approval of the Houthis, Sari said. The abduction came amid increased tensions in the Arabian Peninsula country after the rise of Shiite Houthi rebels. Houthis swept into the capital last year, sparking battles that left more than 300 dead in a month. In September, Houthis signed a ceasefire deal with the government. Since then, its members have installed themselves in key positions in the government and financial institutions. Hadi was elected President in February 2012. He was the only candidate on the ballot.\n"
